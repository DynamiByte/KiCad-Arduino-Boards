# UNO R3
Because this was the first board I recreated, the design process is already covered in the main `README`. Being that this was the first board I made, it was the one that I was able to get a copy of the earliest, so I have fully verified that this design works, and you can see a photo of the board in real life below.

If you are taking the parts from an OEM UNO like I did, I recommend using low-melt solder to aid in the desoldering of through-hole components. The surface mount components come off easily enough with hot air, but when removing the reset switch or electrolytic capacitors, try to heat them from the bottom of the board to avoid applying too much direct heat.

Below are the screenshots of this board from KiCad's 3D board viewer.
