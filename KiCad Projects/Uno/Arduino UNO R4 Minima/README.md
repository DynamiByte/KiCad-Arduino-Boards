# UNO R4 Minima
Like the name suggests, there is not much going on in terms of the components or design of this board, so it was very straightforward to make it.

Even though this board already comes with USB-C from Arduino, the OEM footprint is one that exposes the middle plastic receptacle a bit, so I replaced it with one that has the entire port enclosed.

The biggest painpoints with this board were the silkscreen square etches on the left side and the routing underneath the R7FA4M1AB3CFM#AA0 microcontroller.
