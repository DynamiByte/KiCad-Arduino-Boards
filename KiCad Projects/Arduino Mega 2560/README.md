# Mega 2560
I was expecting this to be the most difficult board to make, but it really wasn't all that bad. It did take the longest, but I broke up the design into small sessions across multiple days.

I don't currently have any projects that require the whopping 54 GPIO pins that this board offers, but I saw that it was commonly used in the robotics and 3D printing spaces, and I've also seen it used to read EEPROM data on Ben Eater's YouTube channel.

Below are the screenshots of this board from KiCad's 3D board viewer.
