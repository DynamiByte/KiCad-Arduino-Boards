# Nano

## Overview
The Nano is a compact and versatile board that surprisingly handles many of my existing projects designed for the UNO. Its small size makes it a great choice for projects where space is at a premium.

## Design Insights
This was the first board in this repository where I had to use a fully surface-mount USB-C connector instead of a through-hole variant. The original Nano also utilizes a surface-mount USB connector, as a through-hole option would interfere with routing and placement on the bottom layer.

While integrating the larger footprint of the USB-C connector, I had to adjust the silkscreen labels near the connector, but I ensured that all the necessary information remained clear and accessible.

## Real-World Application
Additionally, I have successfully built this board in real life and confirmed that it works.
