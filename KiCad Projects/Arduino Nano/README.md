# Nano
I don't remember the specifics, but I believe I made this board in one sitting.

I had never used a Nano before, but I was surprised to find that it was powerful enough to run some of my existing projects that I had written for the UNO. Due to this board's small size and versatility, I do see myself using it for projects in the future.

This board was the first one where I had to use a fully surface-mount USB-C connector rather than one with through-hole legs. The original Nano also uses a fully surface-mount USB connector because a through-hole one would interrupt the routing and placement on the bottom layer. The bigger footprint of the USB-C connector required that I mess with the silkscreen labels right by the USB connector, but everything is still there.

Below are the screenshots of this board from KiCad's 3D board viewer.
