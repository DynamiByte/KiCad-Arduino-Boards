# Leonardo
This board is very physically similar to the UNO, so it was relatively easy for me to work with the design. I like the versatility it offers with two footprints for the ATMEGA32U4.

The HID automation that this board offers would likely be very useful in setups such as setting up many school or work computers with identical settings, though I'm not sure if my version of the design retained this functionality. I'm used to needing a configuration channel logic IC when working with USB-C host/sub switching, but if anyone who knows more about this has any feedback, please let me know.

Below are the screenshots of this board from KiCad's 3D board viewer.
